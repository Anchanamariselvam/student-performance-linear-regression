# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This is my first Machine Learning project!  
It predicts student performance (final exam score) based on features like **study hours** and **attendance percentage** using a **Linear Regression model**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- `linreg.ipynb` â€” Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `Student-Performance.csv` â€” Dataset used for model training and testing.
- `student_performance-LR.pkl` â€” Saved trained Linear Regression model.

## ðŸ§  Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Libraries Used:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Input Features:** Study hours, Attendance  
- **Output:** Predicted Student Score

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anchanamariselvam/student-performance-linear-regression.git
# student-performance-linear-regression
